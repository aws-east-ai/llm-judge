It involves 15 questions of increasing difficulty, with the answer to every question being a single integer from 0 to 999. The median score is historically between 4 and 6 questions correct (out of the 15 possible). Two versions of the test are given every year (thirty questions total). You can view the questions from previous years on the [AIME website](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AIME_Problems_and_Solutions)\n",
